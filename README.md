# Blazing the Nets

Primarily drawn from two projects:

- [https://github.com/ledoux7/nba-d3-react](https://github.com/ledoux7/nba-d3-react)
[demo](http://react-test-123890.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/)
  - everything else
- [Pete Beshai's nba draft app](https://github.com/pbeshai/nba-draft)
  
I haven't seen it, but it's one of his few open-source/simple to re-create projects.
He's a legend in the field for d3, JS, and used to work for the Celtics.

I did manage to finally start to get the NBA data I was interested in, at least locally.
ETL contains the scripts for that and some of that data can be found in public/data/player_dashboard_year_over_year
